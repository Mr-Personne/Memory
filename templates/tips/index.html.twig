                            <p>Try and use all your senses when memorizing something.
                                <br>
                                The more vivid you make your associations, the more readily they’ll come back to you.
                                <br><br>
                                <i>« Smell has strong links with memory: the olfactory bulb (the hub of the sense of smell) and parts of the brain associated with memory and learning have a close physiological connection. » - (page 29)</i>
                                <br><br>
                                <i>« If you can hone your natural ability to make connections and bring alive episodes from your past by using your emotions and senses, as well as logic and creativity, you make it easier for your brain to memorize new information in an instantly vivid, memorable way. In addition, you get used to the sense of letting your brain make the fastest connections and trusting them. Instant association is an important aspect of memory training, because first associations will prove to be the most reliable. » - (page 30)</i>

                            <h3><strong>MEMORY PALACE</strong></h3>
                            <img src="/images/brain.png" alt="" width="200">
                            <p>Another important notion when it comes to memorizing is to use our sense of direction/our memory of locations. It is usually (for most of us) our most developed sense in terms of memorization. 
                                <br><br>
                                So the idea in most cases will be to create the most memorable image possible with the most associations you can create (smell, touch, sound, etc) and place that in a place that you can come back to mentally.
                                <br><br>
                                I’d image if someone asked you to close your eyes and imagine going through your house mentally from the front door, it would be relatively easy (hopefully)? At the very least you should be able to mentally visualize the general structure of your home and some “landmarks” or furniture.
                                <br><br>
                                Once we have such a place, we can use it to place our images in.
                                <br><br>
                                For example, let’s say you wanted to memorize a list of groceries, and let’s say that the first item is an orange. You could first visualize it mentally, its orange color, how it feel to the touch, the taste, and it’s smell. Once all of that seems vivid enough, you would place all those linked sensations at, let’s say, your front door. So now, next time you need to remember what was on your list, you know you can revisit your apartment mentally and you should find back your image that you placed at the front door. And you would continue to do that for each item on the grocery list and place them all along the way in your house.
